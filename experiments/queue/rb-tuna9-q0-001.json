  "research_question": "How much worse is Tuna-9's noisiest qubit (q0, 12.3% readout error) compared to q2 (1.6%)? If the gate error ratio matches the readout error ratio, noise is dominated by measurement. If not, gate errors are qubit-dependent.",
  "description": "Randomized benchmarking on qubit 0 (worst readout). Same protocol as rb-tuna9-q2-001 for direct comparison. 30 circuits total."
